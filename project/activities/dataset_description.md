# Dataset Description

The table represents weekly retail scan data for 2018, detailing national retail volume (units) and price for Hass avocados. Retail scan data is sourced directly from retailers' cash registers, reflecting actual retail sales. Starting in 2013, this dataset includes an expanded, multi-outlet retail dataset. The multi-outlet reporting aggregates data from various channels, including grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military stores.

The AveragePrice column reflects the per-unit cost (per avocado), even when avocados are sold in bags. The Product Lookup Codes (PLUs) included in the dataset apply exclusively to Hass avocados. Other avocado varieties, such as greenskins, are excluded.
